    <h1>Welcome to my home!</h1>
    <p>The is this say that says home is where the heart is,
        allow me to share more about my home.
    </p>
    <p>my home has a kitchen where we make all the food that we 
        really enjoy and learn on how to make new dishes. And is filled with warmth and the aroma 
        to show that is a home. we can see that on the next page <a href="./kitchen.html">kitchen</a></p><br>
        <p>The one place where we gather after a long day and start to share more of what was happening
            during the day. We share more laughter and pains but after that it carries those moments to
            make them memorable. This laounge is our safest place and good for relaxation, see that in the 
            next page <a href="./lounge.html">lounge</a>
